<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The world broke out into making, and at first mainly into aesthetic making. This phase of history, which has been not inaptly termed the &lsquo;Efflorescence,&rsquo; is still, to a large extent, with us. The majority of our population consists of artists, and the bulk of activity in the world lies no longer with necessities but with their elaboration, decoration, and refinement. There has been an evident change in the quality of this making during recent years. It becomes more purposeful than it was, losing something of its first elegance and prettiness and gaining in intensity; but that is a change rather of hue than of nature. That comes with a deepening philosophy and a sounder education. For the first joyous exercises of fancy we perceive now the deliberation of a more constructive imagination.</p></div> </div>

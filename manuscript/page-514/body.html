<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&lsquo;I do not see why life should be judged by its last trailing thread of vitality.... I know it for the splendid thing it is&mdash;I who have been a diseased creature from the beginning. I know it well enough not to confuse it with its husks. Remember that, Gardener, if presently my heart fails me and I despair, and if I go through a little phase of pain and ingratitude and dark forgetfulness before the end.... Don&rsquo;t believe what I may say at the last.... If the fabric is good enough the selvage doesn&rsquo;t matter. It can&rsquo;t matter. So long as you are alive you are just the moment, perhaps, but when you are dead then you are all your life from the first moment to the last....&rsquo;</p></div> </div>

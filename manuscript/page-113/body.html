<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The judge scratched his nose with a quill pen, and sneered at Holsten&rsquo;s astonishment round the corner of his monstrous wig. Holsten was a great man, was he? Well, in a law-court great men were put in their places.</p><p>&lsquo;We want to know has the plaintiff added anything to this or hasn&rsquo;t he?&rsquo; said the judge, &lsquo;we don&rsquo;t want to have your views whether Sir Philip Dass&rsquo;s improvements were merely superficial adaptations or whether they were implicit in your paper. No doubt&mdash;after the manner of inventors&mdash;you think most things that were ever likely to be discovered are implicit in your papers. No doubt also you think too that most subsequent additions and modifications are merely superficial. Inventors have a way of thinking that. The law isn&rsquo;t concerned with that sort of thing. The law has nothing to do with the vanity of inventors.</p></div> </div>

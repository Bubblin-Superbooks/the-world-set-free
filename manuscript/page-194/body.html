<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>When the rather brutish young aviator with the bullet head and the black hair close-cropped en brosse, who was in charge of the French special scientific corps, heard presently of this disaster to the War Control, he was so wanting in imagination in any sphere but his own, that he laughed. Small matter to him that Paris was burning. His mother and father and sister lived at Caudebec; and the only sweetheart he had ever had, and it was poor love-making then, was a girl in Rouen. He slapped his second-in-command on the shoulder. &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s nothing on earth to stop us going to Berlin and giving them tit-for-tat.... Strategy and reasons of state&mdash;they&rsquo;re over.... Come along, my boy, and we&rsquo;ll just show these old women what we can do when they let us have our heads.&rsquo;</p></div> </div>

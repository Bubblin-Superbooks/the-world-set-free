<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Everybody in those days, wise or foolish, believed that the division of the world under a multitude of governments was inevitable, and that it was going on for thousands of years more. It WAS inevitable until it was impossible. Any one who had denied that inevitability publicly would have been counted&mdash;oh! a SILLY fellow. Old Bismarck was only just a little&mdash;forcible, on the lines of the accepted ideas. That is all. He thought that since there had to be national governments he would make one that was strong at home and invincible abroad. Because he had fed with a kind of rough appetite upon what we can see now were very stupid ideas, that does not make him a stupid man. We&rsquo;ve had advantages; we&rsquo;ve had unity and collectivism blasted into our brains.</p></div> </div>

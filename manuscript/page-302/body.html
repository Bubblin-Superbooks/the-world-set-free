<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Advisers! Now I am going to be a real king&mdash;and I am going to&mdash;to abolish, dispose of, finish, the crown to which I have been a slave. But what a world of paralysing shams this roaring stuff has ended! The rigid old world is in the melting-pot again, and I, who seemed to be no more than the stuffing inside a regal robe, I am a king among kings. I have to play my part at the head of things and put an end to blood and fire and idiot disorder.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;But, sir,&rsquo; protested Firmin.</p><p>&lsquo;This man Leblanc is right. The whole world has got to be a Republic, one and indivisible. You know that, and my duty is to make that easy. A king should lead his people; you want me to stick on their backs like some Old Man of the Sea. To-day must be a sacrament of kings.</p></div> </div>

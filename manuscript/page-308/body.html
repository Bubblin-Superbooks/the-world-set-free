<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&lsquo;And yet, you know, there is something in the kingship, Firmin. It stiffened up my august little grandfather. It gave my grandmother a kind of awkward dignity even when she was cross&mdash;and she was very often cross. They both had a profound sense of responsibility. My poor father&rsquo;s health was wretched during his brief career; nobody outside the circle knows just how he screwed himself up to things. &ldquo;My people expect it,&rdquo; he used to say of this tiresome duty or that. Most of the things they made him do were silly&mdash;it was part of a bad tradition, but there was nothing silly in the way he set about them.... The spirit of kingship is a fine thing, Firmin; I feel it in my bones; I do not know what I might not be if I were not a king. I could die for my people, Firmin, and you couldn&rsquo;t. No, don&rsquo;t say you could die for me, because I know better.</p></div> </div>

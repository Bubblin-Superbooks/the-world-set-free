An assistant was seated quietly in the shadow behind the bed. The examination had been made, and Karenin knew what was before him. He was tired but serene.</p><p>&lsquo;So I shall die,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;unless you operate?&rsquo;</p><p>Fowler assented. &lsquo;And then,&rsquo; said Karenin, smiling, &lsquo;probably I shall die.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Not certainly.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Even if I do not die; shall I be able to work?&rsquo;</p></div> </div>

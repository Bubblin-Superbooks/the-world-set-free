<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The state of mind of the dispossessed urban population which swarmed and perished so abundantly over the country-side during the dark days of the autumnal months that followed the Last War, was one of blank despair. Barnet gives sketch after sketch of groups of these people, camped among the vineyards of Champagne, as he saw them during his period of service with the army of pacification.</p><p>There was, for example, that &lsquo;man-milliner&rsquo; who came out from a field beside the road that rises up eastward out of Epernay, and asked how things were going in Paris. He was, says Barnet, a round-faced man, dressed very neatly in black&mdash;so neatly that it was amazing to discover he was living close at hand in a tent made of carpets&mdash;and he had &lsquo;an urbane but insistent manner,&rsquo; a carefully trimmed moustache and beard, expressive eyebrows, and hair very neatly brushed.</p></div> </div>

<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Even when they began to be hit, and their officers&rsquo; whistles woke them up, they didn&rsquo;t seem to see us. One or two halted to fire, and then they all went back towards the wood again. They went slowly at first, looking round at us, then the shelter of the wood seemed to draw them, and they trotted. I fired rather mechanically and missed, then I fired again, and then I became earnest to hit something, made sure of my sighting, and aimed very carefully at a blue back that was dodging about in the corn. At first I couldn&rsquo;t satisfy myself and didn&rsquo;t shoot, his movements were so spasmodic and uncertain; then I think he came to a ditch or some such obstacle and halted for a moment. &ldquo;GOT you,&rdquo; I whispered, and pulled the trigger.</p></div> </div>

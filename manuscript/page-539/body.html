<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&lsquo;I know,&rsquo; said Karenin at last, &lsquo;that many people are saying this sort of thing. I know that there is a vast release of love-making in the world. This great wave of decoration and elaboration that has gone about the world, this Efflorescence, has of course laid hold of that. I know that when you say that the world is set free, you interpret that to mean that the world is set free for love-making. Down there,&mdash;under the clouds, the lovers foregather. I know your songs, Kahn, your half-mystical songs, in which you represent this old hard world dissolving into a luminous haze of love&mdash;sexual love.... I don&rsquo;t think you are right or true in that. You are a young, imaginative man, and you see life&mdash;ardently&mdash;with the eyes of youth.</p></div> </div>

But the proper text-book for kings, Firmin, is none of the court memoirs and Welt-Politik books you would have me read; it is old Fraser&rsquo;s Golden Bough. Have you read that, Firmin?&rsquo;</p><p>Firmin had. &lsquo;Those were the authentic kings. In the end they were cut up and a bit given to everybody. They sprinkled the nations&mdash;with Kingship.&rsquo;</p><p>Firmin turned himself round and faced his royal master.</p></div> </div>

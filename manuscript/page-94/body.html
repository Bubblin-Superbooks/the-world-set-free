<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The desire for little successes amidst conditions securely fixed! So it struck upon Holsten&rsquo;s mind. He added in his diary, &lsquo;I had a sense of all this globe as that....&rsquo;</p><p>By that phrase he meant a kind of clairvoyant vision of this populated world as a whole, of all its cities and towns and villages, its high roads and the inns beside them, its gardens and farms and upland pastures, its boatmen and sailors, its ships coming along the great circles of the ocean, its time-tables and appointments and payments and dues as it were one unified and progressive spectacle. Sometimes such visions came to him; his mind, accustomed to great generalisations and yet acutely sensitive to detail, saw things far more comprehensively than the minds of most of his contemporaries.</p></div> </div>

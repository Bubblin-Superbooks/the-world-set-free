<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> It is true, is it not, that every man is something of a cripple and something of a beast? I&rsquo;ve dipped a little deeper than most; that&rsquo;s all. It&rsquo;s only now when he has fully learnt the truth of that, that he can take hold of himself to be neither beast nor cripple. Now that he overcomes his servitude to his body, he can for the first time think of living the full life of his body.... Before another generation dies you&rsquo;ll have the thing in hand. You&rsquo;ll do as you please with the old Adam and all the vestiges from the brutes and reptiles that lurk in his body and spirit. Isn&rsquo;t that so?&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;You put it boldly,&rsquo; said Fowler.</p></div> </div>

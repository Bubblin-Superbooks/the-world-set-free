That was a poor district and very like the north and the south.... It will be possible to reconstruct most of it.... It is wanted. Already it becomes difficult to recall the old time&mdash;even for us who saw it.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;It seems very distant to me,&rsquo; said the girl.</p><p>&lsquo;It was an unwholesome world,&rsquo; reflected Karenin. &lsquo;I seem to remember everybody about my childhood as if they were ill. They were ill. They were sick with confusion. Everybody was anxious about money and everybody was doing uncongenial things.</p></div> </div>

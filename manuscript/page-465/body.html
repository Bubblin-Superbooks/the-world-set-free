<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> These homes are entirely horrible, uniform, square, squat, hideously proportioned, uncomfortable, dingy, and in some respects quite filthy, only people in complete despair of anything better could have lived in them, but to each is attached a ridiculous little rectangle of land called &lsquo;the garden,&rsquo; containing usually a prop for drying clothes and a loathsome box of offal, the dustbin, full of egg-shells, cinders, and such-like refuse. Now that one may go about this region in comparitive security&mdash;for the London radiations have dwindled to inconsiderable proportions&mdash;it is possible to trace in nearly every one of these gardens some effort to make. Here it is a poor little plank summer-house, here it is a &lsquo;fountain&rsquo; of bricks and oyster-shells, here a &lsquo;rockery,&rsquo; here a &lsquo;workshop.</p></div> </div>

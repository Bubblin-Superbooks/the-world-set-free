<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The worthy man who forestalled the building of a research city for the English upon the Sussex downs by buying up a series of estates, was dispossessed and laughed out of court when he made his demand for some preposterous compensation; the owner of the discredited Dass patents makes his last appearance upon the scroll of history as the insolvent proprietor of a paper called The Cry for Justice, in which he duns the world for a hundred million pounds. That was the ingenuous Dass&rsquo;s idea of justice, that he ought to be paid about five million pounds annually because he had annexed the selvage of one of Holsten&rsquo;s discoveries. Dass came at last to believe quite firmly in his right, and he died a victim of conspiracy mania in a private hospital at Nice.</p></div> </div>

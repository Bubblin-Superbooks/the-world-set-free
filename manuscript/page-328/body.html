There are hundreds and thousands like him. I admit, a certain dexterity, a certain lucidity, but there is not a country town in France where there is not a Leblanc or so to be found about two o&rsquo;clock in its principal cafe. It&rsquo;s just that he isn&rsquo;t complicated or Super-Mannish, or any of those things that has made all he has done possible. But in happier times, don&rsquo;t you think, Wilhelm, he would have remained just what his father was, a successful epicier, very clean, very accurate, very honest.</p></div> </div>

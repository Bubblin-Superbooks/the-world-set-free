People were run over and crushed by the hundred; every year in London the cars and omnibuses alone killed or disabled twenty thousand people, in Paris it was worse; people used to fall dead for want of air in the crowded ways. The irritation of London, internal and external, must have been maddening. It was a maddened world. It is like thinking of a sick child. One has the same effect of feverish urgencies and acute irrational disappointments.</p><p>&lsquo;All history,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;is a record of a childhood....</p><p>&lsquo;And yet not exactly a childhood. There is something clean and keen about even a sick child&mdash;and something touching. But so much of the old times makes one angry.</p></div> </div>

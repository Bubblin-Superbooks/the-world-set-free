He also, he records, owned one of those oil-driven motor-bicycles whose clumsy complexity and extravagant filthiness still astonish the visitors to the museum of machinery at South Kensington. He mentions running over a dog and complains of the ruinous price of &lsquo;spatchcocks&rsquo; in Surrey. &lsquo;Spatchcocks,&rsquo; it seems, was a slang term for crushed hens.</p><p>He passed the examinations necessary to reduce his military service to a minimum, and his want of any special scientific or technical qualification and a certain precocious corpulence that handicapped his aviation indicated the infantry of the line as his sphere of training.</p></div> </div>

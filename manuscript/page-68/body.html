<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> But at present no man knows, no man has an inkling of how this little lump of stuff can be made to hasten the release of its store. It does release it, as a burn trickles. Slowly the uranium changes into radium, the radium changes into a gas called the radium emanation, and that again to what we call radium A, and so the process goes on, giving out energy at every stage, until at last we reach the last stage of all, which is, so far as we can tell at present, lead. But we cannot hasten it.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;I take ye, man,&rsquo; whispered the chuckle-headed lad, with his red hands tightening like a vice upon his knee. &lsquo;I take ye, man. Go on! Oh, go on!&rsquo;</p></div> </div>

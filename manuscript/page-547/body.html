Indeed we love you more.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;But we go about our work,&rsquo; said Edith Haydon.</p><p>&lsquo;So does it matter?&rsquo; asked Rachel.</p><p>&lsquo;If you go about your work and if the men go about their work then for Heaven&rsquo;s sake be as much woman as you wish,&rsquo; said Karenin. &lsquo;When I ask you to unspecialise, I am thinking not of the abolition of sex, but the abolition of the irksome, restricting, obstructive obsession with sex. It may be true that sex made society, that the first society was the sex-cemented family, the first state a confederacy of blood relations, the first laws sexual taboos. Until a few years ago morality meant proper sexual behaviour.</p></div> </div>

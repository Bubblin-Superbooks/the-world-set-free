What is our future&mdash;as women? Is it only that we have unlocked the doors of the imagination for you men? Let us speak of this question now. It is a thing constantly in my thoughts, Karenin. What do you think of us? You who must have thought so much of these perplexities.&rsquo;</p><p>Karenin seemed to weigh his words. He spoke very deliberately. &lsquo;I do not care a rap about your future&mdash;as women. I do not care a rap about the future of men&mdash;as males. I want to destroy these peculiar futures. I care for your future as intelligences, as parts of and contribution to the universal mind of the race.</p></div> </div>

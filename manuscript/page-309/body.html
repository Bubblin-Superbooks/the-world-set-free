Will there be no form of election, for example?&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Why should there be?&rsquo; asked the king, with intelligent curiosity.</p><p>&lsquo;The consent of the governed.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Firmin, we are just going to lay down our differences and take over government. Without any election at all. Without any sanction. The governed will show their consent by silence. If any effective opposition arises we shall ask it to come in and help. The true sanction of kingship is the grip upon the sceptre. We aren&rsquo;t going to worry people to vote for us. I&rsquo;m certain the mass of men does not want to be bothered with such things....</p></div> </div>

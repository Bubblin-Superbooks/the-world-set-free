<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I suppose a desire not to shock the sceptical reader&rsquo;s sense of use and wont and perhaps a less creditable disposition to hedge, have something to do with this dating forward of one&rsquo;s main events, but in the particular case of The World Set Free there was, I think, another motive in holding the Great War back, and that was to allow the chemist to get well forward with his discovery of the release of atomic energy. 1956&mdash;or for that matter 2056&mdash;may be none too late for that crowning revolution in human potentialities. And apart from this procrastination of over forty years, the guess at the opening phase of the war was fairly lucky; the forecast of an alliance of the Central Empires, the opening campaign through the Netherlands, and the despatch of the British Expeditionary Force were all justified before the book had been published six months.</p></div> </div>

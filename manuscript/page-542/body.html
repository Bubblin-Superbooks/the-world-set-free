All these elementals, I grant you, have to be provided for, dealt with, satisfied, but all these things have to be left behind.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;But Love,&rsquo; said Kahn.</p><p>&lsquo;I speak of sexual love and the love of intimate persons. And that is what you mean, Kahn.&rsquo;</p><p>Karenin shook his head. &lsquo;You cannot stay at the roots and climb the tree,&rsquo; he said....</p><p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; he said after a pause, &lsquo;this sexual excitement, this love story, is just a part of growing up and we grow out of it.

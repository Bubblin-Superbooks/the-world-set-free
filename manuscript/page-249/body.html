They looked like little black dashes against the midnight blue. I remember that I looked up at them at first rather idly&mdash;as one might notice a flight of birds. Then I perceived that they were only the extreme wing of a great fleet that was advancing in a long line very swiftly from the direction of the frontier and my attention tightened.</p><p>&lsquo;Directly I saw that fleet I was astonished not to have seen it before.</p><p>&lsquo;I stood up softly, undesirous of disturbing my companions, but with my heart beating now rather more rapidly with surprise and excitement. I strained my ears for any sound of guns along our front.</p></div> </div>

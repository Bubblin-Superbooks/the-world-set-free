The thing is idiotic to the pitch of impossibility. It is a dream. Presently I shall wake up.&rdquo; . . .</p><p>&lsquo;Then the phrase changed itself in my mind. &ldquo;Presently mankind will wake up.&rdquo;</p><p>&lsquo;I lay speculating just how many thousands of men there were among these hundreds of thousands, whose spirits were in rebellion against all these ancient traditions of flag and empire. Weren&rsquo;t we, perhaps, already in the throes of the last crisis, in that darkest moment of a nightmare&rsquo;s horror before the sleeper will endure no more of it&mdash;and wakes?</p></div> </div>

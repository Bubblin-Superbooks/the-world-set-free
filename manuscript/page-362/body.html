And then everything will be over. Meanwhile, if I may be your guest....&rsquo; When presently Pestovitch was alone with the king again, he found him in a state of jangling emotions. His spirit was tossing like a wind-whipped sea. One moment he was exalted and full of contempt for &lsquo;that ass&rsquo; and his search; the next he was down in a pit of dread. &lsquo;They will find them, Pestovitch, and then he&rsquo;ll hang us.&rsquo;</p></div> </div>

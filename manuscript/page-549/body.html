<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&lsquo;Karenin?&rsquo; asked Rachel, &lsquo;do you mean that women are to become men?&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Men and women have to become human beings.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;You would abolish women? But, Karenin, listen! There is more than sex in this. Apart from sex we are different from you. We take up life differently. Forget we are&mdash;females, Karenin, and still we are a different sort of human being with a different use. In some things we are amazingly secondary. Here am I in this place because of my trick of management, and Edith is here because of her patient, subtle hands. That does not alter the fact that nearly the whole body of science is man made; that does not alter the fact that men do so predominatingly make history, that you could nearly write a complete history of the world without mentioning a woman&rsquo;s name.</p></div> </div>

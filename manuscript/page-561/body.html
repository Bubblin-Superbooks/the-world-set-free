<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&lsquo;Beyond humanity,&rsquo; said Kahn.</p><p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Karenin. &lsquo;We can still keep our feet upon the earth that made us. But the air no longer imprisons us, this round planet is no longer chained to us like the ball of a galley slave....</p><p>&lsquo;In a little while men who will know how to bear the strange gravitations, the altered pressures, the attenuated, unfamiliar gases and all the fearful strangenesses of space will be venturing out from this earth. This ball will be no longer enough for us; our spirit will reach out.... Cannot you see how that little argosy will go glittering up into the sky, twinkling and glittering smaller and smaller until the blue swallows it up. They may succeed out there; they may perish, but other men will follow them....</p></div> </div>

Only here and there did a dead cow or a stiff figure still clinging stoutly to a box or chair or such-like buoy hint at the hidden massacre. It was not till the Thursday that the dead came to the surface in any quantity. The view was bounded on every side by a gray mist that closed overhead in a gray canopy. The air cleared in the afternoon, and then, far away to the west under great banks of steam and dust, the flaming red eruption of the atomic bombs came visible across the waste of water.</p><p>They showed flat and sullen through the mist, like London sunsets. &lsquo;They sat upon the sea,&rsquo; says Barnet, &lsquo;like frayed-out waterlilies of flame.&rsquo;</p></div> </div>

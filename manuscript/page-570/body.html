<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> When I am altogether stripped and my disguises thrown away. Very soon now, old Sun, I shall launch myself at you, and I shall reach you and I shall put my foot on your spotted face and tug you about by your fiery locks. One step I shall take to the moon, and then I shall leap at you. I&rsquo;ve talked to you before, old Sun, I&rsquo;ve talked to you a million times, and now I am beginning to remember. Yes&mdash;long ago, long ago, before I had stripped off a few thousand generations, dust now and forgotten, I was a hairy savage and I pointed my hand at you and&mdash;clearly I remember it!&mdash;I saw you in a net. Have you forgotten that, old Sun? . . .</p><p>&lsquo;Old Sun, I gather myself together out of the pools of the individual that have held me dispersed so long.</p></div> </div>

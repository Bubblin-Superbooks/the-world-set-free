<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>One single monarch held out against the general acquiescence in the new rule, and that was that strange survival of mediaevalism, the &lsquo;Slavic Fox,&rsquo; the King of the Balkans. He debated and delayed his submissions. He showed an extraordinary combination of cunning and temerity in his evasion of the repeated summonses from Brissago. He affected ill-health and a great preoccupation with his new official mistress, for his semi-barbaric court was arranged on the best romantic models. His tactics were ably seconded by Doctor Pestovitch, his chief minister.

Finally he professed an unconvincing submission, and put a mass of obstacles in the way of the transfer of his national officials to the new government.</p></div> </div>

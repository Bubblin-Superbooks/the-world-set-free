You know men are blind beside us in these last matters. You know they are restless&mdash;and fitful. We have a steadfastness. We may never draw the broad outlines nor discover the new paths, but in the future isn&rsquo;t there a confirming and sustaining and supplying role for us? As important, perhaps, as yours? Equally important. We hold the world up, Karenin, though you may have raised it.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;You know very well, Rachel, that I believe as you believe. I am not thinking of the abolition of woman. But I do want to abolish&mdash;the heroine, the sexual heroine.
